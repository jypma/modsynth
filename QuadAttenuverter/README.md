# Quad Attenuverter

Based on the design by `[Grumble]` from [synthforum.nl](https://www.synthforum.nl/threads/3811825/page-2), with the following modifications:

- Redrawn in Kicad as a main and io-board
- Made potentiometers more center-sensitive through extra resistors
- Added PCBs for main and io-board
- Added a PCB front panel
