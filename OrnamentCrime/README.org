* Ornament and crime

From [[https://ornament-and-cri.me/][https://ornament-and-cri.me/]], where a full description is available. All functional PCBs are used unchanged.

Changes by me:
- Added PCB front plate

** To do

- The current button footprints are very specific, and I haven't found alternatives for the (expensive) original buttons from mouser. It might be a good idea to change the footprint to more widely-available 6x6 or 12x12 tactile buttons.
